# Introduction 

ðŸ“Š Welcome to my first SQL project, where I explore the dynamic world of the data job market with a special emphasis on data analysis roles.

The dataset encompasses over 700,000 job postings from around the globe in 2023.


## The questions that I wanted to answer through my queries:

## 1. **Analyzing Number of Jobs and Percentage of Home Office and Jobs Not Requiring a Degree**
   - Analyze the number of job postings and percentage of remote work.
   - Determine the percentage of jobs not requiring a degree.

   

```sql
   SELECT 
    COALESCE(CAST(job_work_from_home AS TEXT), 'False') AS job_work_from_home,
    COUNT(job_id) AS number_of_jobs,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(job_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_postings_fact ), 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    job_work_from_home IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY 
    job_work_from_home

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'TOTAL',
    COUNT(job_id),
    100.00
FROM 
    job_postings_fact;
    
```   
## Work From Home Job Distribution
### Data Table

| Work From Home | Number of Jobs | Percentage |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| No (false)   | 718,080      | 91.16%     |
| Yes (true)   | 69,606       | 8.84%      |
| **Total**    | **787,686**  | **100%**   |

 *Pie chart visualizing the work-from-home job distribution*

*The majority (91.16%) of jobs do not offer work-from-home options.
 Only 8.84% of jobs allow remote work, indicating a smaller proportion of remote opportunities.*

 ## Jobs Without Degree Requirement

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(CAST(job_no_degree_mention AS TEXT), 'False') AS job_no_degree_mention,
    COUNT(job_id) AS number_of_jobs,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(job_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_postings_fact ), 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    job_no_degree_mention IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    job_no_degree_mention

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'TOTAL',
    COUNT(job_id),
    100.00
FROM 
    job_postings_fact;
```



## Data Table

| No Degree Required | Number of Jobs | Percentage |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| No (false)       | 546,329      | 69.36%     |
| Yes (true)       | 241,357      | 30.64%     |
| **Total**        | **787,686**  | **100%**   |





![No Degree Pie Chart](assets\no_degree_pie_chart.png)

*69.36% of jobs require a degree.
30.64% of jobs do not require a degree, showing a significant number of opportunities available without higher education.*


## 2. **Top-Paying Jobs and Skills for Those Jobs**
   - Identify the highest-paying jobs in data analytics.
   - Determine the skills most sought after for these positions.

```sql
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short,

    skills_dim.skills
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
LEFT JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    AND skills_dim.skills IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
    skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
