## The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. **Analyzing Number of Jobs and Percentage of Home Office and Jobs Not Requiring a Degree**

To understand the distribution of job opportunities, I analyzed the number of job postings that offer remote work and the percentage of positions that do not require a degree. This query provides insights into job flexibility and the importance of formal education in data analytics roles.
   

```sql
   SELECT 
    COALESCE(CAST(job_work_from_home AS TEXT), 'False') AS job_work_from_home,
    COUNT(job_id) AS number_of_jobs,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(job_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_postings_fact ), 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    job_work_from_home IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY 
    job_work_from_home

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'TOTAL',
    COUNT(job_id),
    100.00
FROM 
    job_postings_fact;
    
```   
## Work From Home Job Distribution
### Data Table

| Work From Home | Number of Jobs | Percentage |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| No (false)   | 718,080      | 91.16%     |
| Yes (true)   | 69,606       | 8.84%      |
| **Total**    | **787,686**  | **100%**   |

![Work From Home Pie Chart](assets/work_from_home_pie_chart.png)
 *Pie chart visualizing the work-from-home job distribution*

### Key Insights:

*The majority (91.16%) of jobs do not offer work-from-home options.*

*Only 8.84% of jobs allow remote work, indicating a smaller proportion of remote opportunities.*

 ## Degree Requirement Analysis

To assess the impact of formal education, I also analyzed the number and percentage of job postings that do not require a degree.


```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(CAST(job_no_degree_mention AS TEXT), 'False') AS job_no_degree_mention,
    COUNT(job_id) AS number_of_jobs,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(job_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_postings_fact ), 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    job_no_degree_mention IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    job_no_degree_mention

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'TOTAL',
    COUNT(job_id),
    100.00
FROM 
    job_postings_fact;
```

## Degree Requirement Data Table

| No Degree Required | Number of Jobs | Percentage |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| No (false)       | 546,329      | 69.36%     |
| Yes (true)       | 241,357      | 30.64%     |
| **Total**        | **787,686**  | **100%**   |

### Key Insights:

*69.36% of jobs require a degree, confirming that formal education is still a significant requirement in most positions.*

*30.64% of jobs do not require a degree, highlighting a sizable number of opportunities available without higher education.*


## 2. **Top-Paying Jobs and Skills for Those Jobs**
To identify the highest-paying roles in data analytics, I filtered job postings by average yearly salary and analyzed the most sought-after skills for these positions. This query highlights the most lucrative opportunities in the field and the key skills required for them.

```sql
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
